# Banana Smoothie
## Overview
A simple, healthy, and clean drink to start of your day. This will allow you to feel healthy and clean to help clean up your digestive tract while tiding off you hunger till lunch. I used to use this drink in the mornings in high school to allow me to survive till lunch as the natural sugars from the bananas gave the needed energy to tackle the first half of the day.
## Ingredients
- 2 bananas
- 1 ½ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon peanut butter
## Instructions
1. Place the 2 bananas, split in half, into your blender
1. Add you milk.
1. Add the peanut butter.

1. To add a little more texture to your smoothie I recommend slicing bananas that are slightly browned and placing them in the freezer.
## Warning
Ensure that you don’t start the blender with your hands near the blade!
