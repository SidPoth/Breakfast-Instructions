# Omelet Toast

Over the pandemic I got into cooking and wanted an easy way to make egg toast in one dish. This method was an inspiration from an egg/roti dish mom used to make me and my brother when we were kids and refused to sit and eat. It is super easy and allows for one to make everything at the same time.

1. Start by adding 1 teaspoon of cooking oil to the pan.
1. Have the stove at medium to high.
1. While to pan is heating up, crack both eggs into a bowl.
1. Add half a teaspoon of salt and pepper to the bowl.
1. Whisk until the eggs are yellow.
1. Slice your bread in half down the middle.
1. Add the egg to the pan.
1. Place your now 2 slices of bread on top of the egg in the pan with half an inch of space between.
1. Once the side of the egg facing you is no longer running, flip the egg and toast.
1. After two minutes fold the sides of the egg hanging off the side of the bread in.
1. Fold the omelet in half like a sandwich.
## Warning
Since we are using a stove in this recipe ensure that you are being safe around the hot stove and pan.
